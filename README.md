# Garam solver
ðŸš§ Work in progress â€” not functional yet ðŸš§

This tool is designed to solve any <a href="https://www.garamgame.com/garam/garam_en_ligne/master/index.html">Garam grid â†—</a>.

Garam is a numerical crossword-style puzzle: fill in the 44 cells so that all 20 arithmetic expressions are simultaneously correct.

# How to use the tool?
1. Go to the root directory and run ```python garam_solver.py```
2. Fill in the grid with the initial digits and operations
3. Click the ```Solve``` button (you probably guessed it)
4. The solution is displayed in plain text on the terminal
5. ???
6. Profit

Note: step 2 is tedious. In the future, a screenshot or a URL _may_ be used to auto-fill of manually entering ~30 values.


# OK, but what was the point of this?
Well, I could not find any solver for this (addictive) game, so I made this.

(No, _I_ made this ðŸ™‚)
