# Garam solver

ðŸš§ Work in progress, <u>does not work yet</u>

This tool solves a [Garam grid](https://www.garamgame.com/garam/garam_en_ligne/master/index.html).

Garam is the numerical version of crossword: fill in the 44 cells so that all 20 arithmerical expressions are simultaneously correct.

# How to use the tool?

1. Go to the root directory and run ```python garam_solver.py```
2. Fill in the grid with the initial digits and operations(*)
3. Click the ```Solve``` button (you'd probably guessed it)
4. ???
5. Profit

<span style="font-size:12px;">(*)Part 2. is tedious. In the future, a screenshot _may_ be fed instead of manually filling ~30 spaces, if I manage to work it out.</span>


# OK, but what was the point of this?

Well, I could not find any solver for this (addictive) game, so I made this.

(No, _I_ made this ðŸ™‚)
